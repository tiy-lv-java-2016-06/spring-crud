# CRUD

![screenshot](screenshot.jpg)

## Description

Design your very own CRUD app using Spring. It must support user authentication (login and logout) and creating/reading/updating/deleting entries. You can store any kind of information you want (within the bounds of appropriateness).

## Requirements

* Choose something you'd like to "track" in a web app.
* User authentication
  * If not logged in, show a login form at the top (it can double as your create account form).
  * If logged in, display the username and a logout button at the top.
  * Passwords MUST be stored securely.
  * Don't allow unauthenticated users to hit routes they shouldn't hit.
* All data must be stored and manipulated using Hibernate.
* Create: If logged in, display a form to create a new entry.
* Read: Whether logged in or not, list whatever entries were created by the users.
* Update: If logged in, show an edit link next to the entries created by that user.
* Delete: If logged in, show a delete button next to the entries created by that user.
* Write tests for your POST routes.

## Hard Mode
* Add JavaScript and CSS (served statically via `resources/static`).
